# b4n

`b4n` is a terminal user interface for the Kubernetes API, created mainly for learning the Rust programming language. It is heavily based on the [`k9s` project](https://k9scli.io).

## Prerequisites

The [Cascadia Code font](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code), or any other font with [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) symbols, is required for proper display of the user interface in the terminal.

## Features

As the project is in its early stages, the following features are currently supported:

- View a list of Kubernetes resources.
- Delete selected resources.
- Display the YAML configuration of the highlighted resource.
- View events for the highlighted resource.
- View logs for the highlighted container.
- Open a shell session in the highlighted container.
- Enable port forwarding for the highlighted container.

### Planned

The following features are planned for future development:

- View combined logs for all containers in a pod.

## Configuration Files

Configuration files are stored in the `$HOME/.b4n` directory. The directory structure is as follows:

```
.b4n/
├─ logs/
├─ themes/
│  └─ default.yaml
├─ config.yaml
└─ history.yaml
```

### logs/

This directory contains application logs, with one log file generated per day.

### themes/

This folder stores all TUI (Text User Interface) themes.  
The `default.yaml` theme will be automatically generated by the application if it doesn't already exist.

You can place additional theme files here by copying them from the `themes` folder or creating your own.

### config.yaml

This file contains configuration settings that control the behaviour of the `b4n` application.  
Here is an example structure:

```yaml
logs:
  lines: 800
mouse: true
theme: light
key_bindings:
  action.name: list of key bindings for that action
  command-palette.open: :, >, Shift+:, Shift+>
  [...]
```

#### Configuration Options

- `logs.lines` – The number of log lines to retrieve from the Kubernetes API for selected container.
- `mouse` – Indicates if mouse support should be enabled when the application starts. Mouse support can also be toggled while the app is running.
- `theme` – The name of the currently selected theme. This should match a file in the `themes` directory (without the `.yaml` extension).
- `key_bindings` – Defines custom key bindings for various application actions.  
  Example key bindings: `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+Alt+A`, `F7`, `Z`, `Left`, `Enter`.

If `config.yaml` does not exist, the application will create it automatically with default values.

### history.yaml

This file stores history for filters, search patterns, and the last selected resource for each Kubernetes context.
To remove history entries (either for a specific context or entirely), you can manually edit this file or even delete it.
